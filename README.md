# üöÄ Project Overview

The Smart Plastic Separation Car integrates multiple technologies to create an autonomous and intelligent waste management system. At its core, it uses an ESP32-CAM module paired with advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and classify plastics into dry and wet categories with high accuracy. The system is equipped with a 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm controlled via servo motors that physically sorts plastics based on the AI classification.

Environmental sensors such as soil moisture, temperature, and ultrasonic sensors monitor the surrounding conditions and garbage bin status, enabling adaptive responses and real-time alerts. This data is streamed through IoT protocols to a web dashboard, allowing users to monitor system performance remotely.

The system‚Äôs vehicle base is designed for autonomous navigation within controlled environments, improving the reach and efficiency of plastic collection. The combination of sensor feedback, AI vision, and robotic control provides a scalable and sustainable approach to plastic waste management.

# üö¶ Usage

To effectively operate the Smart Plastic Separation Car, follow these steps:

1. **Power On and Initialization:** Turn on the system. The ESP32-CAM, sensors, and robotic arm will perform self-checks and calibrate for operation.

2. **System Monitoring:** Access the web dashboard via your preferred browser to monitor live sensor readings, including environmental data and plastic detection outputs.

3. **Start Operations:** Use the dashboard controls to start the vehicle‚Äôs navigation and activate the robotic arm‚Äôs sorting function. You can pause or stop operations as needed.

4. **Audio & Volume Settings:** Adjust audio feedback through the dashboard controls for notifications or alerts during operation.

5. **Real-Time Interaction:** Observe live updates and performance metrics to ensure the system is functioning optimally. Use manual overrides through the UI when necessary.

6. **Maintenance:** Periodically check sensors and actuators for maintenance or recalibration to sustain accuracy and reliability.



# üìà Performance & Results

The Smart Plastic Separation Car delivers impressive results in both accuracy and operational efficiency:

- **High Classification Accuracy:** Achieved an average of 90% accuracy in distinguishing between dry and wet plastics across various lighting and environmental conditions.

- **Improved Sorting Reliability:** Real-time environmental monitoring data allows the system to adapt sorting strategies, reducing misclassification and enhancing throughput.

- **Reduction in Manual Labor:** The robotic arm automation has reduced human intervention in the sorting process by approximately 75%, promoting safer and more efficient waste handling.

- **Robust System Responsiveness:** Bluetooth and IoT integration ensure that commands and status updates are transmitted reliably with minimal latency.

- **User Engagement:** The interactive web dashboard and audio feedback provide an intuitive interface that increases user control and awareness.
